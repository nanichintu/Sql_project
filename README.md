# üìö Online Book Store SQL Project

## üìù Project Summary

This project models an **Online Book Store** where customers can purchase books and place orders. It contains three key datasets representing customers, books, and orders. These datasets are designed with relational integrity using common columns to enable meaningful data analysis and reporting.

The project provides a practical scenario to apply SQL skills such as table creation, data insertion, joins, aggregations, filtering, and complex queries ‚Äî helping learners and developers build real-world database proficiency.

## üîó Relationships and Common Columns

The tables are linked by the following common columns:

- `Customer_ID` in **Customers** and **Orders** tables  
- `Book_ID` in **Books** and **Orders** tables  

These shared columns maintain relational integrity, enable JOIN operations, and facilitate complex queries such as tracking orders by customers or analyzing book sales.

## üí° Example Use Cases

- Retrieve all orders placed by a specific customer.
- Calculate total revenue generated by each book.
- Find customers from a specific city who placed orders.
- List books that are low on stock.
- Track monthly sales and popular book genres.

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Create tables based on the above structure in your SQL database.
2. Import your data into the respective tables.
3. Practice querying with JOINs, aggregations, and filtering to answer business questions.
4. Extend the project by adding new tables such as payments, reviews, or discounts.
